EdNation is an EdTech platform designed to provide high-quality courses while ensuring strong customer engagement. Developed within three hours during a hackathon, this website showcases a selection of courses available for purchase. To enhance user trust and engagement, we feature testimonials from our learners, highlighting their success stories and the companies where they have secured placements. Additionally, we provide a brief introduction to the founder of the company, offering insights into their vision and mission. The website also includes details about the organizations where our learners have been placed and addresses key frequently asked questions to assist potential customers.
